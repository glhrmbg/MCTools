### 📊 MCNP Tally Extractor

Python tool for **extracting and processing tally** data from `.mctal` files generated by MCNP (Monte Carlo N-Particle Transport Code) version **MCNP6** and **MCNPX**.

The script automates the extraction of important information such as **tally names**, **energy/fluence values**, **statistical errors**, **code version (MCNP6, MCNPX)** used, and **number of particles simulated (NPS)** particles, organizing everything into an Excel spreadsheet to facilitate analysis of Monte Carlo simulation results.

### 👨🏻‍💻 How to use

1. Install the dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install pandas openpyxl
    ```
2.  Run the script:
    ```bash
    python tally_extractor.py
    ```
3. Enter the path to the folder containing `.mctal` files
4. Done! The `tally_extractor.xlsx` file will be created in the same folder.

### 🔍 Example

The `mctal/` folder contains an example file to test the script.
